[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f2a69b0569704402b8341aa18979a79b)](https://www.codacy.com/app/tegenton/vertx-gradle-simple?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=tegenton/vertx-gradle-simple&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is simple Hello World Vert.x 3.1 project using the Gradle build system. It initializes a simple HTTP server which
simply returns "Hello World!" with every request.

In this example, Vert.x is used in an embedded fashion. It uses Vert.x APIs directly in its classes rather than
deploying code in verticles.



## Setting up the project

1. *Fork* this git repository and *clone* the fork to a local directory [(Reference)](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook)
